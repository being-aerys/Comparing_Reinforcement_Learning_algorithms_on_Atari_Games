#Deep Reinforcement Learning on Atari Games
This repo shows the results of different reinforcement learning algorithms on Atari games. This work follows
the works from the respective papers as well as the book by Maxim Lapan.

##Algorithms to be Covered:
* Deep Q Network (DQN)
* N-steps DQN
* Double DQN
* Dueling DQN
