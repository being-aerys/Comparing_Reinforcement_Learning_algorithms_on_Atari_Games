## Deep Reinforcement Learning on Atari Games
This repo is a continuous effort to show the results of different reinforcement learning algorithms on Atari games. This work follows
the works from the respective papers as well as the book by Maxim Lapan.

# Install
This project requires python and the following python libraries installed.
1. torch
2. tensorboardX
3. gym
